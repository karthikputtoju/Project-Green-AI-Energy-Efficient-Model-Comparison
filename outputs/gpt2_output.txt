It was also able to sense a person or a person's presence. The AI scientist was called the "human" because it was the closest thing humans could to a human being.

It was a powerful and deadly weapon. Most AI models were capable of being used against humans, but many were deadly due to their limited abilities.

In the end it would be decided by the AI scientist who had the most power, the master of the AI model was chosen, as he would become the leader of the AI scientist's army.
